"""
You're managing ticket sales for a local event with a maximum capacity of 50 tickets.
You need to handle two commands:

sell X — Sell X tickets if enough are available.
view — Show how many tickets are sold and how many remain.
Use the following rules:

If tickets are available, update the count and print:
Successfully sold X tickets. Total tickets sold: Y.
If not enough tickets are left, print:
Cannot sell X tickets. Only R tickets left.
For view, print two lines:
Current tickets sold: Y.
Remaining capacity: R.

Input Format
First line: Integer N — number of operations.
Next N lines: Commands (sell X or view).

Output Format
Print output for each command as described.
Sample 1:


Input:

view
sell 10
view
sell 45
view

Output:
Current tickets sold: 0.
Remaining capacity: 50.
Successfully sold 10 tickets. Total tickets sold: 10.
Current tickets sold: 10.
Remaining capacity: 40.
Cannot sell 45 tickets. Only 40 tickets left.
