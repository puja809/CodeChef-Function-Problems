"""
You are designing a score tracking system for a two-round game. The game maintains a global score variable total_points, which is initially 0.

Your task is to implement two functions:

add_points(points_to_add):
Adds points_to_add to the global variable total_points
Prints: Added <points_to_add> points. New total: <total_points>

get_final_score():
Prints the final total score: Final score is: <total_points>
Handle ValueError if any and print: "Invalid input. Please enter a whole number for points."

Input Format
Two lines of input. Each line contains an integer: the points earned in Round 1 and Round 2.

Output Format
Print messages after each round using add_points.
After both rounds, print the final score.
Lastly, print the global variable value from the main block.

Sample 1:
Input
10
25

Output
Game started. Initial points: 0
Added 10 points. New total: 10
Added 25 points. New total: 35
Final score is: 35
Value of total_points outside functions, at the end: 35

-----SOLUTION-----
total_points=0
def add_points(points_to_add):
    global total_points
    total_points=total_points+points_to_add
    print(f'Added {points_to_add} points. New total: {total_points}')

def get_final_score():
    global total_points
    print(f'Final score is: {total_points}')

print(f'Game started. Initial points: {total_points}')
try:
    m=int(input())
    add_points(m)
    n=int(input())
    add_points(n)
    get_final_score()
except:
    print(f'Invalid input. Please enter a whole number for points.')

print(f'Value of total_points outside functions, at the end: {total_points}')
